# Power Platform Client Guide

1. **Launch Power App**

   Once the solution has been deployed, launch the Power App from [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/).

2. **Upload documents**

   Select "Documents" from the top menu bar in the Power App. Any documents that have been uploaded to the SharePoint repository will appear here. The status column indicates whether the document has been processed and is ready to use in a report.
   To upload a new document, select "Upload new document". This will open the SharePoint repository, where you can upload and tag documents, such as your company's sustainability reports and those of your peers, to use in report generation.

3. **Document Size** 

   Please note documents over 20mb might take more than 1 hour to get uploaded to backend systems depending on your Token Per Minute (TPM) quotas and capacity allocation.

4. **Create a new benchmark assessment or gap analysis** 

   To create a new benchmark or gap analysis, select the relevant option from the Power App home screen or from the top navigation.
   Before you begin creating a new report, you can see which reports have already been created. To create a new report, select "Create a new benchmark assessment" or "Create a new gap analysis".

5. **Select the parameters for the report** 

   Select which CSRD indicator to use from the drop down menu. Note: At this time, only one CSRD assessment can be used per report.

6. **Select the documents to use for analysis** 

   Select your company's Corporate Sustainability Report (CSR) to use for the report from the left column. For benchmark assessment only: Select the peer documents you'd like to benchmark against from the right column. Recommendation: Select up to 3 reports to benchmark against for quicker report generation. The more CSR reports selected, and the longer the report, will result in longer processing times.
   
7. **Name the report** 

   Give the report a unique name so you can easily identify it later.

8. **Submit the report for processing** 

   Select "Submit" to initiate the AI processing and generation.

9. **Review report details** 

   After you press submit, review the details of the report you just created.

10. **Notification from Copilot in Teams** 

    Once the report is ready, you will receive a notification from Copilot within Teams.

11. **Open the report** 

    Click the link to open the full report.

12. **Chat with the report** 

    With Copilot in Teams, use natural language to chat with the report. Note: Copilot responses prioritize knowledge from the more recent output document. However, you can ask questions of older output documents. Note that, as with other AI generation tools, AI-generated content may be incorrect.

13. **Chat with the report in PowerApp** 

    Please note that the copilot component in the PowerApp is under preview at the time of the release of this solution accelerator. It doesn't respond as consistently as the copilot does in MS Teams. When this goes under General Availability, the response times are expected to be better. However, under the hood, the PowerApp and MS teams are using the same copilot built in Copilot Studio.

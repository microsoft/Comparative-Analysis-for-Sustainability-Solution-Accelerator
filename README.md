# Comparative Analysis for Sustainability

This solution accelerator enables companies to advance sustainability initiatives with precision by using AI to compare company's reports to peers, benchmark them against industry standards, and quickly create a plan of action. Compliance standards applied: Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ([CSRD](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en)) and Global Reporting Initiatives ([GRI](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards)).

Solution overview
</h2>

This solution accelerator enables companies to detect compliance gaps, benchmark against their peers, and generate action plans to ensure they’re on track to meet their sustainability goals. Leveraging the simplicity of PowerApps, users can easily upload documents and generate gap analyses and benchmarking reports for GRI and CSRD indicators. An AI-generated report is then created, which provides a brief summary of the company’s (and their peer’s) performance, similarities/dissimilarities, and an action plan for improvement. The user can also use natural language with a Teams Copilot to ask questions about the reports to further aid understanding and actionability.

### Solution architecture

Below is a sample landing page of the solution accelerator after it is deployed, set up, and ready to be used. You will need to replace Microsoft Logo with your own company's logo.

### Prerequisites and Costs
To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. 

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available. Here is an example region where the services are available: `canadacentral`.

You will also need to have Power Platform License to deploy the sample Power Platform Client Solution.  A prior understanding of Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft Power Power Platform, Azure Open AI, Azure AI Search, Azure AI Document Intelligence will be helpful. 

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription.

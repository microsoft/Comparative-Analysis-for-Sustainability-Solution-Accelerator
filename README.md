**Solution accelerator overview**

This solution accelerator enables companies to detect compliance gaps, benchmark against their peers, and generate action plans to ensure they’re on track to meet their sustainability goals. Leveraging the simplicity of PowerApps, users can easily upload documents and generate gap analyses and benchmarking reports for GRI and CSRD indicators. An AI-generated report is then created, which provides a brief summary of the company’s (and their peer’s) performance, similarities/dissimilarities, and an action plan for improvement. The user can also use natural language with a Teams Copilot to ask questions about the reports to further aid understanding and actionability.

Please review the [**Release Notes Page**]( ./Deployment/docs/ReleaseNotes.md) to see what is new.  

**Scenarios**

As a sustainability manager or sustainability analyst, you will be able to use the solution to perform below business functions:  

- Analyze your company's sustainability document and obtain insights and recommendations to help your corporation to identify gaps and take actions to achieve set sustainability goals. 
- Compare your sustainability document with your peers' sustainability documents and obtain benchmark and gap analysis reports. In most of the cases, you will be able to download your peers' sustainability documents from their public facing websites. 

**Solution Accelerator Landing Page**

Below is a sample landing page of the solution accelerator after it is deployed, set up, and ready to be used. You will need to replace Microsoft Logo with your own company's logo.

### Important Notes on Branding 

We used Microsoft as a sample company with Microsoft sustainability data to illustrate a more realistic experience. You will need to replace Microsoft Logo in user interface with your own company logo, replace Microsoft Sustainability data with your own sustainability data, and perform comparative analysis against your own peers' sustainability data in your industry, which may be available to the public for download. 

Third-parties are not authorized to use Microsoft company branding for their own purposes.
